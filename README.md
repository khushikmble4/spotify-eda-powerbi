Exploratory Data Analysis of Spotify songs using Python and Power BI
# 🎧 Spotify Songs EDA & Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Spotify songs dataset
using Python and visualizes insights using Power BI.

The goal is to understand patterns in song popularity, genres, artists, duration,
and explicit content.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI
- GitHub

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains 6,300 Spotify tracks with the following attributes:
- Song name
- Artist
- Genre
- Popularity score
- Duration (ms)
- Explicit flag

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA includes:
- Popularity distribution analysis
- Genre frequency and popularity analysis

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Most songs fall within a mid popularity range.
- Song duration mostly lies between 2–4 minutes.
- Explicit content does not significantly impact popularity.
- Genre and artist trends influence popularity more than duration.

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Include audio features such as danceability, energy, tempo.
- Analyze trends over time using release date.
- Build popularity prediction models.
